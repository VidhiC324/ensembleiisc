Announcement regarding newsletter and website revival

<!--more-->

After surviving 4th semester, it was time to revive the newsletter and the website. So, since none of us had any important work to do in our summers (what about our summer projects?? well....), we co-authored the July edition of the Ensemble newsletter and kickstarted the website again. You can subscribe to our newsletter, mailing list and check out the important upcoming events in our website . Enjoy!
