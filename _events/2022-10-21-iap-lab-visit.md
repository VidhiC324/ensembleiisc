Visit to the IAP Department

<!--more-->

We are very excited to launch the Perspective Series, which will include a variety of activities aimed towards 2nd Year Undergraduates in order to give them an idea about life as a researcher in Physics. Throughout the Perspective Series, we'll try to provide valuable insight into the nitty-gritties of a life in physics. 

Our very first activity in this series will be a lab tour at the **Instrumentation and Applied Physics Department** to be held on **Friday (28th October from 2pm - 5pm)**.

**For 2nd Year UGs**
Students will be shown around some of the labs and given guided tours by researchers at the respective labs about the cutting edge research that goes on. This expedition will be instrumental (pun intended) to give an idea about life as an experimental physicist as well as try to bridge the gap between textbook and real world research.
We strongly urge all 2nd years to participate in this session and interact with the people in various fields of Physics throughout the Perspective Series.

**For 3rd Year UGs and above**
Others are also welcome to join in. In addition, we would appreciate it if people would volunteer to help handle the logistics and chaperoning during the tour. Please reach out to me if you interested in volunteering for the lab tour.

**Timing: 2pm-5pm
Venue: IAP Department
Date: 28th October**

Looking forward to an enthusiastic response!
