Abstract: Programmable quantum simulators today provide versatile platforms for studying intriguing many-body phases and dynamics of correlated quantum systems. In this talk, motivated by recent experimental advances, we explore the quantum phases of matter and dynamics that can be probed using one such platform: two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays.  
First, we investigate the efficient preparation of quantum states in these systems using either adiabatic protocols or shortcuts thereto. In particular, we develop a universal description of the systemâ€™s quantum coarsening dynamics to address the question of how long-range order develops as a function of time, if it does at all, in a fundamentally out-of-equilibrium setting.  
Secondly, we show that the combination of Rydberg interactions and appropriate lattice geometries naturally leads to emergent Z2 and U(1) gauge theories endowed with matter fields. Based on this mapping, we demonstrate how Rydberg platforms can be used to realize exotic topological spin liquid states based solely on their native van der Waals interactions.
