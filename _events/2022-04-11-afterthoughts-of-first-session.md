Hello people!
Thanks a lot to everyone who came to attend yesterday, we were honestly overwhelmed by the turnover and are extremely enthusiastic about the upcoming series which we have lined up for this year. 
Once again, a huge thanks to our speakers Yash Mehta(who couldn't be there in person but gave valuable input), Ayanesh, Archisman, Divij, and Aritra for taking time out of their busy schedules to talk about their research interests for us. Feel free to reach out to any of them in case you have questions.
Also special thanks to Dikshant and Kenil for helping us out on the technical sides. We have uploaded the presentation from the session in Teams and will be uploading some pics on the Gallery on the website as well.
 
Speaking of the website, we would like a couple of people, preferably first years to help us keep the website up to date. The interface(WixSite) is very easy to navigate and no technical pre-requisites are required. Interested people do DM either of us.
 
Also, posted below is the link to a form in case you are interested in being added to the Ensemble mailing list, or if you have any valuable suggestions or feedback on current or future Ensemble activities.
