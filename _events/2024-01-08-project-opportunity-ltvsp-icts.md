Details regarding long-term project opportunity

<!--more-->

ICTS brings a great long-term project opportunity under the "Long-term Visiting Students Program (LTVSP)". Currently under this program, a graduate student at the University of Waterloo, Devashish Tupkary (an IISC alumnus), along with his advisor, Prof. Manas, is offering a project on open quantum systems, and he is looking for undergrads to help him with the project. To get more details and/or to apply for the project, mail him (preferably with your CV) at djtupkar@uwaterloo.ca. But before mailing him, you must apply for the LTVSP program, which you can see here: (https://www.icts.res.in/academic/long-term-visiting-student-program). In your LTVSP application, make sure to mention that you want to work with Prof. Manas on open quantum systems. Also, for folks generally interested in topics like QKD, you can reach out to Devashish if you have any questions or maybe ask about how his research group is.
