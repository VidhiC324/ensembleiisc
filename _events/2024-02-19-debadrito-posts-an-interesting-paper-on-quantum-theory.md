An Interesting Read!

<!--more-->

I know all of you must be swamped with a plethora of midterms, exotic electives and Open Day work. However, I stumbled upon this paper today and it was a really interesting read. I would suggest you all to give this entire paper a proper read sometime and form your own opinions!
 
Its titled: **Quantum theory cannot consistently describe the use of itself**
 
This topic isn't anything new or unexplored per se. Since the advent of Quantum Mechanics, there have been numerous "thought experiments" in an attempt to justify the universality of Quantum Theory (especially the idea of being able to deploy Quantum Mechanical tools to understand macroscopic systems) and/or bring out flaws and fallacies in its construct. None of these thought experiments of the 20th century provide a definitive yes or no but they are interesting to read about nonetheless! This 2018 paper (attached with this post) tries to elaborate on and then extend a thought experiment by Wigner and Deutsch, trying to get closer to answering this pressing question!
