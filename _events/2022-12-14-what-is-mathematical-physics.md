Talk on Mathematical Physics

<!--more-->

Ensemble we are excited to announce our latest talk in the Perspective Series by Pespective Series by Prof. Vamsi Pingali. The talk will be on Mathematical Physics and is aimed to help those who are struggling with the cliched Physics vs Math identity crisis.

The talk will be held on **16 December (Online)** and the link and the timings will be shared soon.

**Title:** What is Mathematical Physics

**Abstract:** I shall give a brief overview of mathematical physics (along with an overview of topics in mathematics and physics). I shall also mumble a few vague words about my research. It will be a short talk aimed more at answering questions more than hearing myself speak.

Looking forward to seeing you all there! 


> [Update]
The talk will take place at **3 pm, 16 December**.
