Talk on Cosmic History

<!--more-->

We will be having the talk by Prof. Tarun Souradeep (Director, Raman Research Institute) at **6pm** on **Friday (10th February)**, at the **Physical Sciences Auditorium**.
 
**Title:** Quest for Cosmic Origin
**Speaker:** Tarun Souradeep
**Affiliation:** Raman Research Institute

**Abstract:**
The origin of our Universe, a quest as old as humanity, is just beginning to be unraveled. Over the past few decades, spectacularly deep inroads and high precision inferences on Cosmic history and origin have been made possible, largely from increasingly exquisite measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The CMB sky has much more to reveal !!! This includes a grand prize of detecting cosmic gravitational waves emanating within atto-attoseconds of ‘big-bang’ that would potentially mark the mechanism and energy scale of new ultra high-energy physics.
 
Looking forward to an enthusiastic response
