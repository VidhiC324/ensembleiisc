<!--more-->

We are excited to announce the final phase of our activities planned for our stint as the coordinators for 2022-23. It's been a great experience for us to be organising such interesting activities and the marvellous turnouts from your side were a big factor in motivating us to have more such sessions.
Before we hand over the responsibilities for the next coordinators, we still have 5 amazing talks planned by researchers from various fields and institutes. The schedule(tentative for some) is as follows:
 
**1) 17/01 6:00pm Prof. Sunil Mukhi(Offline)**: Prof. Mukhi is an Adjunct Professor at ICTS and an Honorary Professor Emeritus at IISER Pune. He will be delivering a talk on his research in High Energy Physics. The exact venue and the abstract of the talk will be announced soon.
**2) 27/01 6:00pm Prof. Tarun Souradeep(Online)**: Prof. Souradeep is the Director of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Raman Research Institute and is actively involved in the LIGO India project. The abstract of the talk will be shared soon.
 
Activities Scheduled for February:
Although the exact dates for these talks haven't been finalised yet, we will be having the following speakers delivering talks on their research interests as well as the basic overlying theme of research and discovery.
**3) Prof. B. Ananthanarayan**: Prof. Ananthanarayan is a professor at CHEP, IISc. He will be talking about discovering novel phenomena in research.
**4) Robin Bajaj**: Robin is an Int. PhD at the Physics Department, IISc in the Quantum Theory of Materials Group and will be talking about his research in Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics.
**5) Ayan Banerjee**: Ayan is a PhD at IISc in the SSCU Department at the Theory and Computation of Materials Group and will be talking about his research in Condensed Matter Theory, especially in the field of Non-Hermitian Quantum Phases.
 
We hope you will all participate enthusiastically in these talks and interact with some really accomplished and talented researchers.
