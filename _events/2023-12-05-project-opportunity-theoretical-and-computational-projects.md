Details regarding three project sets

<!--more-->

**Please refer to the project description attached below.**
 
**Theoretical and Computational Projects**
Jointly supervised by a PhD student at IST Austria and a postdoc at IISc.
 
Multiple projects available all in the field of ion traps, all with a time requirement of about 10-20h/week (not inclusive of program runtime :)). Basic competence with python expected (mostly use of numpy, scipy, and matplotlib)
 
**Project set 1 requirements**: Understanding of and comfort with classical mechanics and electromagnetism
 
**Project set 2 requirements**: Understanding of and comfort with Quantum mechanics at the level of Quantum Measurement and Control
 
**Project set 3 requirements**: Understanding of and comfort with Quantum mechanics at the level of CMP1 (the one which Shenoy takes, not SSP), maybe CMP2
 
The project will start after 15Dec/1Jan
Project will take 4-8 months depending on how the project evolves
Depending on how the project goes, we might call in other profs to (co-)supervise the project
If interested, just drop an email from you iisc id to shawalda@ist.ac.at with the subject "Ion Traps Project" and in the main body please just mention which year you are in and which project you are interested in. Please don't attach a CV or write a long email describing your inspiration to ask for this project. For any questions, send an email to the same email id with subject "Question: Ion Traps Project" and describe your question, and I will try to answer it as soon as possible. Responses would be slow on weekends, but on weekdays, I will attempt to answer any email sent before 1PM IST on the same day.
