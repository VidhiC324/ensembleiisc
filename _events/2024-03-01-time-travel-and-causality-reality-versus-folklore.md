Screening of "Back to the Future"

<!--more-->

We bring to you a novel activity, something closely related to physics yet approachable by all! We invite you to a **screening of the blockbuster cult classic "Back to the Future"**, a movie that has no doubt inspired many aspiring physicists to play around with the concepts of time travel and such. Following the screening of the movie, we will have an impromptu discussion on the basic movie logic, while Nikshay Chugh will enlighten us on a [choice paper]({% link https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12887.pdf %}), underlining concepts of **causality and how it is relevant in physics.**
 
Come join us for a fun evening!
 
Venue: MLH, opp. to the UG office.
Date: 2nd March, 2024 (Saturday)
Time: 6PM
