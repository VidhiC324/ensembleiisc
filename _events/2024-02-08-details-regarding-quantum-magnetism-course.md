Dear All,
 
  Prof. Nandini Trivedi, who is a Satish Dhawan Chair Professor at the Physics Department, IISc, will offer a short course on quantum magnetism. Please see below for details.
First Class: February 14, 2024, 11:00 am -12:00 pm.
Venue: LH-04, Physics Annex Building
 
From ordered magnets to quantum spin liquids: From spontaneously broken symmetry to topological order
Nandini Trivedi
 
How does the bosonic wave function change to include topological defects, entanglement, and go toward describing a system with topological order
 
 
L1: Heisenberg model mapping to hard core bosons
            Condensate fraction

L2: Variational wave functions, Marshall sign and violations
L3: Topological defects
L4: Discussion of numerical results; Student Presentations
L5: Quantum Entanglement
L6: Discussion of numerical results; Student Presentations
 
Techniques: Exact diagonalization, Variational Monte Carlo
Models: Quantum Ising model, Heisenberg type models, Kitaev type models
