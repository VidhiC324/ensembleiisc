The time has arrived. It’s time to prepare for Decoherence!

Come over at **9:30pm** tomorrow **(14th March)** and learn about our plans this year. We will be declaring dates for the multiple rounds, discussing format and telling you guys what we need from volunteers this year. Be part of the discussion!
Venue: G01
Why attend? ~we were hoping you guys love physics~
Treats will be given in subsequent meetings; once we have a list of confirmed volunteers.
See you there!
**P.S.**
If you plan on volunteering for Decoherence, please attend the first meeting. It will help us plan things.
