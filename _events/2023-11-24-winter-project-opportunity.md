Details regarding winter project

<!--more-->

A fellow student reached out to us with a project proposal for the upcoming winter. Please find details below:
 
**Project proposal:**
(Physics) Theoretical and Computational
To be jointly supervised by a PhD student at IST Austria and a postdoc at IISc.
Understanding and comfort in quantum mech and python, preferably also comfortable with CMP1, maybe 2
 
The project is in the field of ion traps and stuff, but more towards implementation parts and talking to experimentalists.
 
The project will start after 15Dec/1Jan, but quite a bit of time commitment is expected (~20-30h/week)
 
Project will take 4-8 months
 
4th/5th years preferred, but 3rd years with strong backgrounds are also encouraged to apply.  If interested, you can email Samarth Hawaldar at samarth.hawaldar@ist.ac.at. No CV necessary, He will talk to the people before giving the project.
 
If you are interested in pursuing this, please do the needful.


**Please refer to the addendum attached below for your perusal:**

Another project in classical mechanics (plasma physics) also available that will require less time commitment. 
I just need someone who understands classical mech and some electromagnetism. Any year works and this might end up requiring lower time commitment of about 15 hours per week. Knowing Python is a plus, but not absolutely necessary.
