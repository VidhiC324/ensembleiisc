Project Presentations by senior physics majors, Nisarg Amit Chadha and Senin Ahammed AP

<!--more-->

We have scheduled a project presentation by two physics majors from our senior batch, Nisarg Amit Chadha and Senin Ahammed AP. They will be talking about the work they did in their 3rd summer, along with the various programs and opportunities present for physics majors. Hoping to see you all there!
 
Date: 29th August, 2023
 
Time: From 9 pm onwards
 
Venue: G-21, OPB

**About Senin's Talk:**
My primary focus lies within the realm of nanofabrication, particularly in the fascinating field of creating dielectric metasurfaces. These are like super small surfaces that can manipulate light in amazing ways, and it's a part of a bigger area called metasurface optics. So, I extend a warm invitation to individuals intrigued by the realms of nanoscience, semiconductor technologies, and the world of dielectric metasurfaces. If you're also someone who's starting a project that involves nanofabrication, you're absolutely welcome.
I also intend to delve into insightful conversations about the ANU-FRT (Australian National University-Future Research Talent Awards) Program and the Jagadish Endowment Program, sharing my personal experiences from my time at the Australian National University, where I had the chance to visit in the last summer.
Beyond these topics, I am enthusiastic about addressing inquiries concerning overseas internship or thesis prospects in the field of Physics. This is especially true for those of you interested in experimental aspects. And if you're curious about the best way to approach experts directly through emails, I've got insights to share.
Your participation and curiosity are greatly encouraged, whether it's about nanofabrication, metasurface optics, research programs, university experiences, international internships in Physics, or effective communication approaches. Feel free to be a part of the conversation!

**About Nisarg's Talk:**
Non-Hermitian systems have gained popularity in describing non-equilibrium phenomena. They show certain characteristic phenomena that are not present in their hermitian counterparts. The skin effect is one such phenomenon, characterized by an exponential localization of eigenvector amplitude at one edge of the system(if this seems too much, think evanescent waves). It has been shown that the skin effect has a topological origin, with the topology in question also being a consequence of the non-Hermiticity. 
 
I shall focus on a recently exhibited variant of the skin effect, seen in lattices with dislocations, and talk about the topological characterization of the dislocation skin effect. I will talk about why known topological invariants fail to describe the dislocation skin effect, and introduce the real-space localizer index as a successful invariant for describing the dislocation non-Hermitian skin effect.
 
I will try to keep the talk as accessible as possible, although an introductory knowledge of linear algebra will be helpful.
 
This work was done over this summer at IFW Dresden and funded by the DAAD-WISE programme. I will give a brief introduction to the DAAD-WISE programme, and will be happy to entertain questions regarding the same.
 
Looking forward to your participation!!
