Just a book I found interesting!

<!--more-->

Came across this interesting book on Mechanics by Giovanni Gallavotti titled: The Elements of Mechanics. Giovanni Gallavotti is a highly decorated physicist and a noted name in Statistical Mechanics amidst other fields. 
This book on mechanics caught my attention as its takes a beautiful and mathematically rigorous route in establishing the fundamentals of Mechanics that we have grown up with! Just wished to share it here in case anybody would like to go through it at some point.
