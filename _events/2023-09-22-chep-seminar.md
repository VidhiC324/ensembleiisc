Title: The Power of Lorentz Invariance
 
Abstract:
Effective Field Theories (or Quantum Field Theories at long distances or low energies) find applications in diverse branches of physics, in particular, particle physics, cosmology, and condensed matter systems. Thus narrowing down the space of consistent Effective Field Theories (EFTs) is an important and useful exercise. In this talk, I will discuss how the Lorentz-invariant notion of causality imposes nontrivial constraints on low-energy EFTs.  In particular, I'll compare the two different ways to get these constraints: the "IR avatar" - where one demands that the speed of fluctuations about any non-trivial background is subluminal, and the "UV avatar" - where one uses dispersion relation for 2â†’2 scattering in the forward limit.
