In this talk, we will discuss how to solve differential equations of the form:

for many kinds of f(t) including polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponentials and their products and linear combinations.
 
With this method, there is no need to memorize Laplace transform tables, use Green's functions, or use Variation of Parameters. It is even much faster than guessing solutions using undetermined coefficients. This method comes very handy to quickly solve ODEs without Mathematica, such as when solving lengthy exam papers, and saves a lot of time.
 
In addition, we will discuss the solution of weakly anharmonic oscillators (classical) using perturbation theory (not to be confused with quantum mechanical perturbation theory). The very same equation turns up in the calculation of the perihelion shift of Mercury -- one of the classical tests of GR 

**Details:**
Venue: F12, OPB
Timings: 11:00 AM - 12:00 noon
Date: Tomorrow, 1st of May
 
**Prerequisites:**
High school mathematics is sufficient
Bring a notebook / notepad as the talk will be mathematical and be done on the blackboard. If you don't write things down you might not follow or remember.
Forget your rigorous mindset at home, along with your UM101 notes. 

Now that examinations are over for all the batches, we invite all of you to the talk. The talk is particularly targeted towards 1st and 2nd years, and will discuss an indispensable trick to solve ODEs. Although this is being conducted by the physics club, solving ODEs is important in many branches of science and so we invite all of you Chemistry, Biology, Materials and Math enthusiasts as well!
